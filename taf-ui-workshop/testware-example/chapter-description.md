## Create Maven project

- you need to define proper structure for the project:
  - testware module
    - contains all tests, scenarios and suites
    - has all kind of configuration files for successful run
  - operators module
    - contains re-usable operators, test steps, flows
    - in future will have views definitions, custom view components
  - test pom module
    - this module responsibility is to run your tests

- setup required imports and dependencies
- run first firefox test
